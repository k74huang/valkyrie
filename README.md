# wallpaper-browser
 Simple web interface to hold my wallpaper collection, WIP at the moment
 
## Todo: 

- Add popup when image clicked to view it in larger size
- Python script to automatically add new walls to html file because I can't host a backend on GitHub pages xd
- Python script to generate thumbnails of all the walls so the users aren't loading like 3.5 gigs at a time lmfao
- Rewriting logic somewhere so that only a certain number of walls load at a time and you can scroll to load more
- Adding tabs to also view mobile walls and misc. cute pics I save
